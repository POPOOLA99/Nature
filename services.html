        <h4>
          Nature provides a variety of services to people, known as ecosystem
          services, including:
        </h4>
        <li>
          Provisioning services: These are products that come directly from
          nature, such as food and water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regulating services: These services help control climate and disease,
          such as carbon sequestration and flood control.
        </li>
        <li>
          Supporting services: These services include nutrient cycles and oxygen
          production.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cultural services: These are non-material benefits that come from
          interacting with nature, such as recreation, spiritual and aesthetic
          pleasure, and a sense of place.
        </li>
        <h3>
          The health of ecosystems is directly linked to human well-being, and
          people depend on ecosystems for survival. However, the demand for
          natural resources is growing, putting pressure on the environment. If
          ecosystems are not properly maintained, people and other species could
          lose out.
